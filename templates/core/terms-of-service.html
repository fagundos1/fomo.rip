        <h1>Terms of service</h1>
        <p><br>Last Updated: August 9nd, 2022
        <p><p><br><h2>Introduction</h2>
            <br>Welcome to Fomorip (“Fomorip,” “we,” “us”, or “our”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Fomorip website(s). For purposes of these Terms, “user”, “you”, and “your” means you as the user of the Service. BY CLICKING TO ACCEPT AND/OR USING OUR SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND ALL OF THE TERMS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE. Fomorip is not a wallet provider, exchange, broker, financial institution, money services business, or creditor. Fomorip provides a peer-to-peer web3 service that helps users discover and directly interact with each other and digital items available on crypto market. To use our Service, you must use a third-party wallet which allows you to engage in transactions on blockchains.
            <br>Fomorip is not party to any agreement between any users. You bear full responsibility for verifying the identity, legitimacy, and authenticity of digital items that you purchase from third-party sellers using the Service and we make no claims about the identity, legitimacy, functionality, or authenticity of users or digital items (and any content associated with such Ndigital items) visible on the Service.
            <br>Fomorip reserves the right to change or modify these Terms at any time and in our sole discretion. If we make material changes to these Terms, we will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of such changes, such as by providing notice through the Service or updating the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of these Terms. By continuing to access or use the Service, you confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms and all of the terms incorporated therein by reference effective as of the date these Terms are updated. It is your sole responsibility to review the Terms from time to time to view such changes and to ensure that you understand the terms and conditions that apply when you access or use the Service.
            <p><p><br><h2>Accessing the Service</h2>
                <br>Like much of web3, your blockchain address functions as your identity on Fomorip. Accordingly, you will need a blockchain address and a third-party wallet to access the Service. Your account on the service (“Account”) will be associated with your blockchain address; however, if you want to add some flair to your Fomorip persona, you can add additional information, such as a profile picture, to your Account. Your Account on Fomorip will be associated with your linked blockchain address. By using your wallet in connection with the Service, you agree that you are using that wallet under the terms and conditions of the applicable provider of the wallet. Wallets are not operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with Fomorip, and Fomorip does not have custody or control over the contents of your wallet and has no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. Fomorip accepts no responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection with your use of a wallet and makes no representations or warranties regarding how the Service will operate with any specific wallet. You are solely responsible for keeping your wallet secure and you should never share your wallet credentials or seed phrase with anyone. If you discover an issue related to your wallet, please contact your wallet provider. Likewise, you are solely responsible for your Account and any associated wallet and we are not liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with your Account or as a result of your Account or wallet being compromised. You agree to immediately notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security issues related to the Service or your Account (you can contact us here).
                <br>You also represent and warrant that you will comply with all applicable laws (e.g., local, state, federal and other laws) when using the Service. If you access or use the Service , you are solely responsible for ensuring that your access and use of the Service in such country, territory or jurisdiction does not violate any applicable laws.
                <br>Fomorip may require you to provide additional information and documents in certain circumstances, such as at the request of any government authority, as any applicable law or regulation dictates, or to investigate a potential violation of these Terms. In such cases, Fomorip, in its sole discretion, may disable your Account and block your ability to access the Service until such additional information and documents are processed by Fomorip. If you do not provide complete and accurate information in response to such a request, Fomorip may refuse to restore your access to the Service.
                <br>Your access and use of the Service may be interrupted from time to time for any of several reasons, including, without limitation, the malfunction of equipment, periodic updating, maintenance, or repair of the Service or other actions that Fomorip, in its sole discretion, may elect to take. If your Account becomes inactive for six months or longer, as determined by Fomorip in its sole discretion, you understand that Fomorip may disable your Account or reassign your username or associated url.
                <br>We require all users to be at least 18 years old. If you are at least 13 years old but under 18 years old, you may only use Fomorip through a parent or guardian’s Account and with their approval and oversight. That account holder is responsible for your actions using the Account. It is prohibited to use our Service if you are under 13 years old.
